      <p class="is-size-4">A possible corruption scandal has clouded one of the most important decisions in a global
        sporting event: the selection of Qatar as the World Cup host for 2022.
        Thinking of selecting a country or city as host for any large event — the Super Bowl, Olympics, or even a large
        conference — always implies thinking of infrastructure such as stadiums and hotels, but also, in intangible factors incluiding 
        the legal, and political atmosphere in the possible host, as well as the intentions of the governing body of
        sending a message with the selected choice.
      <h2 class="is-size-3">The decision to chose Qatar has been highly critiziced on emotional factors. Looking at unbiased data directly from FIFA, 
        football’s governing body, and external data helps to to evaluate the polemical decision more objectively.</h2>
      <p class="is-size-4">FIFA recently published the full executive summary of bids for countries that wanted to host
        the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.
        Qatar was the only country with a High Risk for overall operational risk, out of the 11 countries evaluated by
        the FIFA as bidders for the 2018 and 2022, World Cups. The FIFA also concluded there was a High Risk for Team facilities, a
        first red flag.

      }
    }))
  }();
</script>

<p class="is-size-4">
  Criticism against the decision includes still unproven allegations that oil money was behind the
  decision to select a
  country with no real history in the sport.</p>

<p class="is-size-4">“We are playing in a country that FIFA says they want to develop football there,” influential
  Netherlands head coach
  Louis van Gaal, said late in March.
  “That's bullshit, but it doesn't matter. It's about money, about commercial interests. That matters in FIFA.”</p>

<p class="is-size-4">
Qatar barely met the minimum requirements asked by FIFA to host a World Cup, as it failed to secure the
  requested 48 training sites for the teams and proposed only 36.
  The table also illustrates the requirements to host a World Cup, a key part of the selection process.

</script>


<p class="is-size-4">
While FIFA used its own standards to measure the bids, and even highlighted the risks of Qatar,
  using other non-biased parameters to compare Qatar can also enlighten if the country was the right choice or not.
  Infrastructure can be hard to compare between countries, but will use the index from the World Bank.
  Qatar came second to last, only above Russia.

For the political and legal atmosphere,
  a look at The Economist’s Democracy Index can also be helpful.
  Qatar again came second to last only after Russia that hosted the prior World Cup, another red flag.

<p class="is-size-4">
The FIFA World Cup, played every four years, is the most important football event in the world, with Qatar expected to generate
  $6.8bn in revenue, mostly in media rights and advertising.
  Hard data does not sustain FIFA's choice of Qatar as a good choice, with several red flags and the country ranking second
  to last in almost all analyzed categories. The analysis could even serve as arguments in favor of possible bribes to the FIFA to chose Qatar.</p>
  <p class="is-size-4">
  <b>Yet, football, and specially the World Cup, as any sport, is a celebration of life. The joy of Qataris from
  hosting a
  global party and seeing their team compete
  for the first time at a global scale is hard to measure.</b>

  <p class="is-size-4">
    I used FIFA's executive summary bids for most of the data. Since it was a PDF I used a PDF converter to extract numbers and text. 
    <a href="https://digitalhub.fifa.com/m/2123788449fd9424/original/ayheyvitgkcpamaxzovz-pdf">Document can be found here.</a>
    For The Economist's index I used the full 
     <a href="https://www.economistgroup.com/group-news/economist-intelligence/democracy-index-2021-less-than-half-the-world-lives-in-a-democracy">Democracy Index 2021</a>.
    And for the World Bank Infrastructure Index I used the 
    <a href="https://lpi.worldbank.org/international/global">data bank</a>.
